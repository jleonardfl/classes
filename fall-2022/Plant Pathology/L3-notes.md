Lecture 3

Oomycetes = fungal-like organisms
Slide 2 - Oomycetes vs Fungi

Slide 4 - Terminology
Mycelium - filamentous vegetative body
Hyphae - individual branches of mycelium
Rhizomycelium - system of dissimilar strands produced by lower true fungi (like slime molds) that lack true mycelium
Plasmodium - previously thought to be fungi, now classified as amoeboid

Reproduction - spores (asexual vs sexual) - slide 6-8
* mainly reproduce through spores
* many fungi can reproduce sexually or asexually
Asexual: know the spore types (sporangium, zoosporangium, conidiophores)
Sexual: zygospores, ascospores, basidospores, oospores (sexual spores have the group name+spore)

Fungi reproduce sexually by combining male and female hyphae

Imperfect Fungi: only asexual
Sterile Fungi: undiscovered reproductive behavior

Classification of Fungal Plant Pathogens
* large, diverse group
* fungal-like organisms
  * Kingdom Protozoa
  * Kingdom Chromista
* True fungi
  * Kingdom Fungi
  

Myxomycetes - slime mold
Plasmodiophoromycetes - clubroot of crucifers, powdery scab of potato
Chyjkasdkjhasj - black wart of potato, crown wart of alfalfa, brown spot of corn
Oomycetes - seed rot/seedling damping off, root and stem rot, blight, tuber rot, soft rot, white rust

Myxomycota
* Myxomycetes (slime molds)
